## A basic Transfer Learning Application for using `InceptionV3` Model

- aim was to train a custom model on the `InceptionV3` model for X-RAY Images of patients having pneumonia
- secondary aim was to evaluate the trained model and provide a few test inferences

## Test Inference from the custom trained model
